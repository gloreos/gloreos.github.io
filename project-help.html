    <!--PROBLEM-->

        <h2 class = "project__h2">// PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>Content is outdated and achitecture is whack. As an intern for ZapLabs, I was tasked with going through the articles from our Help Center and identifying outdated articles. The hope was that I could simultaneously learn about our company’s product and help the marketing team with clean-up. But I quickly realized, the Help Center would need more than a little clean up. It was difficult to navigate, outdated, and overwhelming.</p>
        <p>EARLY KNOWLEDGE BASE, PRIOR TO REDESIGN</p>

    <!--PROCESS-->
    <section class = "background background--grey">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">// PROCESS</h2>
        <p>After I transitioned into a full time position, the team endeavored to redesign the Help Center. I conducted an audit of the 76 articles that made up our Help Center and documented the following fields: Article name, Category, Page views in 2018, and Date last updated.</p>
        <p>With this content audit, I wanted to achieve two main objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Categorize articles into headings and subheadings that make sense</li>
          <li>Simplify and standardize existing articles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1. Categorize</h3>
        <p>Taking the content audit, I combed through each article and began grouping them together according to our company’s user journey map. Then, I made a few tweaks to help make the information easier to access.</p>

    <!--FINAL TAKEAWAYS-->

          <div class = "container container--padding">
            <h2 class = "project__h2">// FINAL TAKEAWAYS</h2>
            <p>Less is more. Agents don’t want to read. Don’t make them.</p>
            <p>Engage other disciplines. The support team spends most of their days engaging with agents and helping to resolve their issues. They had a good grasp of where our help content was lacking.</p>
            <h3 class = "project__h3">Steps for improvement</h3>
            <p>Conduct a card sort. Next time, I would like to conduct a card sort with our agents. That way, we could rest assured that the categories we proposed made sense to our end user.</p>
