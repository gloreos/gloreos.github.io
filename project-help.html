    <!--PROBLEM-->

      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">// PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>Content is outdated and achitecture is whack. As an intern for ZapLabs, I was tasked with going through the articles from our Help Center and identifying outdated articles. The hope was that I could simultaneously learn about our company’s product and help the marketing team with clean-up. But I quickly realized, the Help Center would need more than a little clean up. It was difficult to navigate, outdated, and overwhelming.</p>

        <p class="image__caption">EARLY HELP CENTER, PRIOR TO REDESIGN</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!--PROCESS-->
    <section class = "background background--grey">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">// PROCESS</h2>
        <p>After I transitioned into a full time position, the team endeavored to redesign the Help Center. I conducted an audit of the 76 articles that made up our Help Center and documented the following fields: Article name, Category, Page views in 2018, and Date last updated.</p>
        <p>With this content audit, I wanted to achieve two main objectives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Categorize articles into headings and subheadings that make sense</li>
          <li>Simplify and standardize existing articles</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="flex-wrapper">
          <h3 class="subsection">Categorize</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Taking the content audit, I combed through each article and began grouping them together according to our company’s user journey map. Then, I made a few tweaks to help make the information easier to access.</p>

        <p class="subsection"><span class="bold">LONG LISTS > SCANNABLE LISTS</span> Lacking any hierarchy, the Knowledge Base was difficult to navigate. I broke up the articles into smaller subsections.</p>
        <img class="container__half1--responsive caption" src="img/help/longLists.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
        <img class="container__half2--responsive caption"src="img/help/scannableLists.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
        <p class="container__half1--responsive caption">BEFORE: LONG LISTS</p>
        <p class="container__half2--responsive caption">AFTER: SCANNABLE LISTS</p>

        <p class="subsection"><span class="bold">FEATURE-FOCUSE HEADINGS > SCANNABLE HEADINGS</span> The original headings consisted of nouns and feature names. This could be confusing for agents who weren’t familiar with how we titled our features. I developed headings that could be paired to an agent action.</p>
        <img class="container__half1--responsive caption" src="img/help/featureFocusedHeadings.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
        <img class="container__half2--responsive caption" src="img/help/actionableHeadings.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
        <p class="container__half1--responsive caption">BEFORE: FEATURE-FOCUSED HEADINGS</p>
        <p class="container__half2--responsive caption">AFTER: ACTIONABLE HEADINGS</p>

        <p class="subsection"><span class="bold">INCONSISTENT GROUPINGS > INTUITIVE GROUPINGS</span> Some closely-related articles were grouped into separate categories. For example, “Local Insights” and “Property Insights” were categorized under Requests and Tasks and Zap Website and Apps, respectively. For the redesign, I made sure to group like features together.</p>

        <div class="flex-wrapper">
          <h3 class="subsection">Simplify</h3>
        </div>
        <p>I interviewed stakeholders, including the Customer Support team, to discover areas for improvement. Our main takeaways from these conversations was that these tutorial articles were too long and too wordy.</p>
        <p class="subsection"><span class="bold">LONG ARTICLES > SHORTER ARTICLES</span> The Knowledge Base articles were wordy and hard to scan. We cut down needless copy.</p>
        <img class="container__half1--responsive" src="img/help/longArticles.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
        <img class="container__half2--responsive" src="img/help/shorterArticles.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
        <p class="container__half1--responsive caption">BEFORE: LONG ARTICLES</p>
        <p class="container__half2--responsive caption">AFTER: SHORTER ARTICLES</p>

        <p class="subsection"><span class="bold">WALLS OF TEXT > VIDEOS AND IMAGES</span> Agents were frustrated by having to read, so we added more pictures.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Less is more.</span> Agents don’t want to read. Don’t make them.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Engage other disciplines.</span> The support team spends most of their days engaging with agents and helping to resolve their issues. They had a good grasp of where our help content was lacking.</p>
            <h3 class = "project__h3">Steps for improvement</h3>
            <p><span class="bold">Conduct a card sort.</span> Next time, I would like to conduct a card sort with our agents. That way, we could rest assured that the categories we proposed made sense to our end user.</p>
