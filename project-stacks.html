<!--SUMMARY-->
    <section class="background background--white">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>As part researcher and designer, I designed and tested a prototype demonstrating three basic user flows: organizing content, creating and uploading files, and managing account settings. I employed the tools, Figma and Invision to deliver on these final mockups.</p>
        <h3 class = "project__h3">The Problem</h3>
        <p>Students need a robust system that allows them to share and collaborate on projects—whether this be small projects, such as a one-off class assignment or large projects, such as a student magazine. Despite competition in the cloud storage market, there is no current system optimized for small, creative projects.</p>
        <h3 class = "project__h3">The Solution</h3>
        <p>Stacks is a cloud-collaboration tool catered to student groups. Users can create and upload files and share them across their teams. Stacks focuses on visual organization and ease of use to help minimize the friction of working with several collaborators.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

<!--RESEARCH-->
    <section class="background background--lightpurple">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>I conducted a user survey to identify 1) how students use cloud storage for their school projects and 2) their needs and frustrations. This survey revealed:</p>
        <ul class = "research__ul">
          <li><span>93.3%</span>  of participants used cloud storage services for school projects.</li>
          <li><span>58.8%</span>  of participants employed cloud storage for personal projects or school projects that consisted of small teams (2-3 people).</li>
          <li><span>92.9%</span> of participants valued sharing and collaborating on projects in real time.</li>
          <li><span>78.6%</span> of participants valued the option to upload files from a computer device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class = "project__h3">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>I began my competitive analysis by conducting a <a href="#">SWOT analysis</a> of the tools, Google Drive, Asana, and Pinterest.</p>
        <div class = "container__all flex-wrapper">
          <img class = "research__logo--google" src = "img/stacks/driveLogo.png" alt="Google Drive Logo">

          <img class = "research__logo--pinterest" src = "img/stacks/pinterestLogo.png" alt="Pinterest Logo">
        </div>

        <h3 class = "project__h3">User Personas and Stories</h3>
        <p>Drawing from my user surveys and competitive analysis, I developed two personas:</p>

        <div class = "container__all flex-wrapper">
          <img class = "research__persona" src="img/stacks/arthurPersona.png" alt="Male College Student">
        </div>
        <div class = "container__all flex-wrapper">
          <h3>Arthur Arty, 18</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "container__all flex-wrapper">
          <h3>Student</h3>
        </div>
        <p><span>Biography</span> Arthur enjoys arts and entertainment. Last summer, Arthur developed a short film with some old high school friends. He used Google Drive to collaborate with his crew.</p>
        <p><span>Motivation</span> Arthur is eager to receive feedback on his assignments. He’s aware he can be sensitive to criticism, but wants to open up anyway.</p>
        <p><span>Goals</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upload files from computer and mobile devices</li>
          <li>Comment on areas of a text document or image</li>
          <li>Manage revision history with ease</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>Frustrations</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No drawing capability or integration with tablets</li>
          <li>Reliance on wifi to manage files</li>
          <li>Folders within folders makes it difficult to organize projects</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <p><span>Biography</span> Cherie’s an industrial engineering major. She works hard and strives to be at the top. She feels frustrated when her teammates don’t pull their weight.</p>
        <p><span>Motivation</span> Cherie wants to focus on her project assignments without the stress of coordination problems.</p>
        <p><span>Goals</span></p>

            <li>Delegate specific project tasks to teammates</li>
          </ul>
        <p><span>Frustrations</span></p>
        <ul class = "list">
          <li> Web and native experiences on mobile slow to load files</li>
          <li>Limited formatting capabilities, compared to Word</li>
          <li>Cloud collaboration products don’t identify scheduling issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class = "project__h3">User Stories and Flows</h3>
        <p>I created a list of user tasks and ranked them by priority (low to high). For the scope of this project, I focused on high priority tasks, particularly optimizing collaboration tools and usability.</p>
        <p>Then, I created user flows to represent high and mid-priority tasks.</p>

<!--BRANDING-->
    <section class="background background--grey">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">BRANDING</h2>
        <p>I began to think of the naming and branding of Stacks by identifying the product’s unique qualities. Some qualities I had in mind:</p>
        <ul class = "list">
          <li>smart but not condescending</li>
          <li>creative but not impractical</li>
          <li>good-natured but not doting</li>
          <li>cross-functional but not excessive</li>
          <li>organized but not compulsive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I created lists and word clouds before landing on the name, Stacks. “Stacks” indicates any group of objects, from bricks to boxes to oreos. A stack can be creatively constructed, but must also be orderly and balanced.</p>
        <img src="img/stacks/stacksSketch.png" alt="Stacks Logo Sketches">
        <p>Eventually, I landed on a simple design with three lines. The diagonal line provides visual interest and represents the potential for creativity while keeping the logo minimal.</p>

<!--ITERATION-->
      <section class="background background--white">
        <div class = "container container--padding">
          <h2 class = "project__h2">ITERATION</h2>

          <h3 class = "project__h3">Wireframes</h3>
          <p>I wanted to design a solution which eased collaboration for student groups and teams. I focused primarily on the flows for creating, uploading, and organizing documents.</p>
          <img src="img/stacks/dashboardSketch.png" alt="Stacks Dashboard Sketch">
          <img src="img/stacks/modalsSketch.png" alt="Stacks Modal Sketch">
          <p>Once I finished sketching out my ideas, I created <a href="#">lo-fidelity mockups</a> to test with users.</p>

          <h3 class = "project__h3">Mockups</h3>
          <p>I conducted 8 moderated user tests across two rounds of iteration, low-fidelity and hi-fidelity. I asked users to conduct four primary tasks: sign up for an account, create a project, upload a photo, and upgrade your account.</p>

          <h3 class = "project__h3">Preference Testing</h3>
          <p>Throughout the design process, I had to iterate on my design. The landing page itself went through several font and stylistic changes. I was divided on which font to use for the heading, so I preference tested between the fonts, Montserrat and Moon 2.0. Once I decided to use the Montserrat font, I also made changes to the formatting to make the content more readable.</p>
          <div class = "container__half1">
            <img src="img/stacks/preferenceTest_montserrat.svg" alt="Stacks Preference Test: Montserrat">

          </div>
          <img class = "container__half2" src="img/stacks/preferenceTest_final.svg" alt="Stacks Final Landing Page">

          <h3 class = "project__h3">Deep Dive: Organization</h3>
          <p>I learned several insights from my rounds of user testing, but the “organization” flow was the most challenging to act on.</p>

          <img class="container__half1--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration1a.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
          <img class="container__half2--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration1b.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
          <p class="container__half1--responsive"><span class="bold">BEFORE</span> People understood the copy, <span class="italics">Workspace</span> as a folder. They were confused that clicking <span class="italics">Project</span> would open up another folder.</p>
          <p class="container__half2--responsive"><span class="bold">AFTER</span> Changed <span class="italics">Workspace</span> to <span class="italics">Dashboard</span> and <span class="italics">Project</span> to <span class="italics">Workspace</span>. The dashboard gives a general overview, whereas the workspace functions as a folder.</p>

          <img class="container__half1--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration2a.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
          <img class="container__half2--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration2b.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
          <p class="container__half1--responsive"><span class="bold">BEFORE</span> When asked to upload a photo, users were drawn to the big plus button under “Recent Projects” and completely missed the tiny ghost button, labelled “+Add”.</p>
          <p class="container__half2--responsive"><span class="bold">AFTER</span> Removed the large button on the left navigation and changed the CTA to a primary button.</p>

          <img class="container__half1--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration3a.svg" alt="Stacks Lo-fi">
          <img class="container__half2--responsive" src="img/stacks/iteration3b.svg" alt="Stacks Hi-fi">
          <p class="container__half1--responsive"><span class="bold">BEFORE</span> The copy, “Main Stacks” was supposed to be a section for important files. It was supposed to be a play on the product name, “Stacks,” but really, it was just confusing.</p>
          <p class="container__half2--responsive"><span class="bold">AFTER</span> After a round of preference testing, changed “Main Stacks” to simply, “Pinned items”.</p>
        </div>

<!--FINAL TAKEAWAYS-->
    <section class = "background background--grey">
      <div class = "container container--padding">
        <h2 class = "project__h2">FINAL TAKEAWAYS</h2>
        <p><span class="bold">Use plain language.</span> Interface copy needs to be clear and simple. I realized I shouldn’t try to impress users in the product. All I need to do is guide them to where they need to go.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">User testing is key.</span> The user tests I conducted were immensely helpful for narrowing my scope and making my design more straightforward.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Design takes diligence.</span>  With each iteration, I had to go back into my mockups and make several little tweaks. This was both detail-oriented and time-intensive. Design may look like lines and buttons on a page, but there’s a lot that goes into it.</p>
        <h3 class = "project__h3">Steps for improvement</h3>
        <p><span class="bold">Start off with strong user research.</span> Although the user surveys were helpful for providing general guidance, I would have liked to understand my users more personally. Next time, I would devote more time to research and interviewing my users.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Use components or symbols.</span> I didn’t realize the importance of using layers and symbols until I found myself copy and pasting elements over and over again. Next time, I will start my design process by creating a components library and name my layers as I’m going.</p>
