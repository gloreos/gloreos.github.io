  <!--ABOUT ME-->
      <div class = "container about__content">
        <h1 class="flex-wrapper about__title">About Me</h1>
        <img class="container__half1--responsive about__photo" src="img/aboutPhoto.jpg" alt="Profile Photo">
        <p class="container__half2--responsive"><span class="emphasis">My passion for design</span>—as my passion for many things—must have begun with a book. Not a design book (not yet), but I’m sure it was some book. Maybe, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie or Diary of a Spider?
          <br><br>
          In a roundabout way, reading was my first step into design thinking. Beginning to see the world from another character’s perspective. A cab driver? A government agent? A mother of two? I loved to trace out—not the user’s journey—the hero’s journey.
          <br><br><span class="emphasis">My next immersion to design</span> must have been the eleventh grade, when my English teacher taught my class to “gather the evidence” before writing the thesis. You’d think it’s that simple. But then at university, I learned, “there’s always more evidence.” You turn in the best draft you can.
          <br><br><span class="emphasis"> These small lessons</span> in reading and writing formed the foundation to my design career. I just hadn’t known it yet. When I was finally introduced to that one design book—The Design of Everyday Things?—I thought it was pretty neat. People like the author, Don Norman, were (kind of) doing what I was doing! They asked questions. Why can’t we open our doors? They gathered evidence. People struggle to open this kind of door and that sort of door. They wrote a thesis. We should make these kinds of doors.
          <br><br>Sounds fun. Why not try? And I jumped in.
          <br><br><span class="emphasis">I recently started as</span> a part UX Writer/Researcher, and there’s a lot to learn. But I find myself falling into a nice rhythm that reminds me of the writing process.
          <br><br>I love stories, and strangely enough, I’ve grown into a love for writing essays. Somehow, that’s brought me here. To design. Hello, nice to meet you!
